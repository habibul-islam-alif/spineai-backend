            "- Disc spaces are (preserved / narrowed at [level]).\n"
            "- [e.g., Endplate sclerosis and osteophytes consistent with (mild / moderate / severe) degenerative disc disease or Schmorl's nodes noted at [level] for thoracic].\n"

            "### Facet Joints and Posterior Elements\n"
            "- Facet joints are (normal / degenerative at [level]).\n"
            "- No evidence of pars defect or posterior element fracture [or Pars interarticularis defect seen at [level] bilaterally/unilaterally — spondylolysis for lumbar].\n\n"

            "- Odontoid is (intact / fractured).\n"
            "- C1-C2 alignment is (normal / widened at atlantodental interval suggesting instability).\n\n"

            "- Sacroiliac joints are (normal / show sclerosis / narrowing).\n"

            "### Soft Tissues\n"
            "- [e.g., Prevertebral soft tissues are (normal / widened, suggestive of trauma or infection) for cervical or Paraspinal lines and visible soft tissues are unremarkable for thoracic].\n"
